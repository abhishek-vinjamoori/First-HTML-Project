		<h4>My personality:</h4>
		<p>I am very picky and love to be in smaller groups. I am active and love to be outside, but hate my own things to be messy.Participative Leadership (Democratic) Generally the most effective leadership style. Democratic leaders offer guidance to group members, but they also participate in the group and allow input from other group members. Employees are often less productive than under the authoritarian group, but their contributions are of a much higher quality. Participative leaders encourage group members to participate, but retain the final say over the decision-making process. Group members feel engaged in the process and are more motivated and creative.</p>
